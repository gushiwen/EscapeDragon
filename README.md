# EscapeDragon
The previous chapter was a pretty good introduction to bitmap graphics programming. We learned that Pygame has a lot of good features for work- ing with bitmaps. But, aside from the capabilities of the pygame.transform module, which includes scaling and rotation of bitmaps, there is no practical way to do animation with it. This is where the pygame.sprite module takes over, and that is the subject we’re learning about in this chapter. <br />

In this chapter, you will learn to:<br />
• Manually animate a sprite with a special calculation <br />
• Use features in the pygame.sprite module<br />
• Make a game called Escape the Dragon!
